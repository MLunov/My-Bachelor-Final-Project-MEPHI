# My Bachelor Final Project
My Bachelor's Degree Final Project on Gravitational Dynamics of a Cluster of Primordial Black Holes in Applied Math and Computer Science at National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute)

##  Abstract 
During my bachelor's studies I was working in the area of gravity and cosmology
in National Research Nuclear University MEPhI. I was studying gravitational dynamics of a cluster of primordial black holes (PBH) 
(radius of cluster R = 10^(-5)[pc] and summary mass of holes M = 10^6[M of the Sun]). My task was to simulate evolution
of this system by using N-body numerical method (Ahmad-Cohen Scheme) and investigate the issue of its dynamic stability, namely, the nature of the change in its mass spectrum with time in the process of the formation of a stable cluster. Modeling via MATLAB showed that during gravitational dynamics of PBH the formation of a stable cluster around the formed massive body is observed. In all cases that were played, a central massive BH was formed, absorbing the main part of low-mass BH, and black holes of intermediate (between central and low-mass) masses circling around it.

The three-dimensional numerical simulation was carried out in the interval from 50 to 100 bodies. In the process of modeling of course the necessary laws of physics were taken into account, excluding
some specifics (for example, Hawking radiation), and various ways to optimize the computational
process (Ahmad-Cohen scheme) were used.
